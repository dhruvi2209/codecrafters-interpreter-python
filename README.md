# codecrafters-interpreter-python
This project implements a Lox interpreter in Python, inspired by the book Crafting Interpreters. The interpreter supports parsing and evaluating expressions, including handling binary operators, literals, and grouping. This implementation is a part of a step-by-step development process aimed at creating a fully functional Lox interpreter.
