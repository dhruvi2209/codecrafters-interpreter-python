# Lox Interpreter
This project implements a Lox interpreter in Python, inspired by the book Crafting Interpreters. The interpreter supports parsing and evaluating expressions, including handling binary operators, literals, and grouping. This implementation is part of a step-by-step development process to create a fully functional Lox interpreter.
